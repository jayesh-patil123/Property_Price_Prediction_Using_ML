🏡 Property Price Prediction - Conclusion 📊

1️⃣ Model Performance Analysis

The project aimed to predict property prices using various machine learning models. Based on the evaluation metrics (R² Score, MAE, and RMSE), we can draw the following conclusions:

Linear Regression performed extremely poorly with an unrealistic negative R² Score and massive errors. This suggests that the data is not linear, possibly due to outliers, feature scaling issues, or multicollinearity.

Decision Tree Regressor performed moderately well with an R² Score of 0.7082, meaning it explained ~70% of the variance in property prices. However, it may suffer from overfitting on training data.

Random Forest Regressor improved significantly with an R² Score of 0.8380, lower error values, and better generalization due to ensemble learning.

Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) was the best model, achieving the highest R² Score (0.8790) and lowest RMSE (19883.17), indicating the most accurate predictions.

2️⃣ Final Model Selection

🔹 Gradient Boosting Regressor is the best model for this project as it provides the highest accuracy and lowest prediction errors.

🔹 Random Forest is a strong alternative but slightly less accurate than GBR.

3️⃣ Future Improvements & Recommendations

🚀 Hyperparameter Tuning – Further tuning of the Gradient Boosting model (learning rate, max depth) may improve performance.

📊 Feature Engineering – Adding new features (e.g., location-based variables) and refining existing ones may enhance predictions.

🔍 Handling Outliers & Scaling – Better outlier detection and normalization may improve Linear Regression results.

💾 More Data & Cross-Validation – Using more training data and k-fold cross-validation can increase model robustness.
